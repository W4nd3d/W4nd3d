# üë®‚Äçüíª Wanded ‚Äì Programming, Gameplay Dev & Game Designer apprentice

Hi! I'm Wanded. At the moment I specialize in **Python** & **Luau (Roblox Studio)**, I began learning programming on January 27, 2025. My focus is on building dynamic game systems and structure clean code, scalable and purpose-driven. This profile is a new window to my progress as a self-taught programmer & student on Conquer Blocks Academy.

## üß† Actual Knowledge

### Languages
- **Python**  
  - Solid understanding of syntax, control structures, and error handling.  
  - Basic functional programming concepts.  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (transitioning into full adoption).  
  - Practical applications: visual novel engine, automation scripts, learning tools.

- **Lua / Luau**  
  - Core syntax and language fundamentals.  
  - Integrated usage within Roblox Studio.  
  - Proficient with events, functions, modules, and core game logic.  
  - Practical applications: combat and stat systems, PvE mechanics, UI functionality.

## üìö Ongoing Learning

### Concepts & Paradigms
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
  - Gradual implementation of SOLID principles.  
  - Modular system design using classes and components.

- **EDP (Event-Driven Programming)**  
  - Reactive logic flow based on user input or system signals.  
  - Proficient understanding of event listeners, callbacks, and decoupled trigger-response architecture.  
  - Actively applied in game development (e.g., `Touched`, `MouseClick`, `InputBegan` in Roblox Studio).

- **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)**  
  - Basic understanding of iterative and recursive algorithmic patterns.  
  - Practical use of lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples for data modeling and control flow.

### Platforms
- **Roblox Studio**  
  - Intermediate proficiency with Explorer, Workspace, Properties, and hierarchy navigation.  
  - Familiar with LocalScript, Script, and ModuleScript (in progress).  
  - UI systems implementation (e.g., health bar, inventory).  
  - Event-driven systems using `RemoteEvent`, `BindableEvent`, `Touched`, etc.  
  - Experience with external modules like `ShapecastHitbox`.

- **Git & GitHub**  
  - Basic version control operations: `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`.  
  - Project structuring with `README`, `.gitignore`, and branch management.

## üéØ Future Focus

- Design of combat systems (PvE & PvP)  
- Scalable game architecture using components and modular design  
- Emergent gameplay and non-linear storytelling (inspired by *RimWorld* / *Dwarf Fortress*)  
- Refactoring personal engines with Object-Oriented Programming  
- Advanced proficiency in data structures and algorithms  
- Implementation of design patterns: Observer, Component, Factory, and more  
- Development of custom tools for Roblox Studio  
- Professional collaboration on GitHub (Pull Requests, Issues, Code Reviews)

## üìÇ Actives Projects

- **Novel Visual Engine on Python**  
  Currently being refactored using OOP. Handles multiples scenes, dialogue, choices and smooth navigation.

- **Combat System on Roblox Studio**  
  Prototipe in progress. Includes: stamina, wheight, velocity, evasion, parry, and functional PVE logic.

### ü§ù Searching for:

- Opportunities to learn by collaborating on real proyects. 
- Technical feedback on my repositories.  
- Connections with other self-taught developers.
