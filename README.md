# üë®‚Äçüíª Wanded ‚Äì Programming, Gameplay Dev & Game Designer apprentice

Hi! I'm Wanded. At the moment I specialize in **Python** & **Luau (Roblox Studio)**, I began learning programming on January 27, 2025. My focus is on building dynamic game systems and structure clean code, scalable and purpose-driven. This profile is a new window to my progress as a self-taught programmer & student on Conquer Blocks Academy.

## üß† Actual Knowledge

### Languages
- **Python**  
  - Complete understanding of syntax, control structures, and error handling.  
  - Basic functional programming.  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (transitioning to a full focus).  
  - Practical applications: visual novel engine, personal scripts.

- **Lua / Luau**  
  - Essential syntax.  
  - Integrated in Roblox Studio.  
  - Events, functions, modules, and basic game logic.  
  - Practical applications: combat/stats scripts, PvE systems, UI functionality.

## üìö Ongoing Learning

### Concepts & Paradigms
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
  - Gradual application of SOLID principles.  
  - Modular design using classes and components.

- **EDP (Event-Driven Programming)**  
  - Reactive logic flow based on signals or user input.  
  - Understanding of event listeners, callbacks, and decoupled trigger-response architectures.  
  - Applied in game development (e.g., `Touched`, `MouseClick`, `InputBegan` in Roblox Studio).

- **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)**  
  - Basic iterative and recursive algorithms.  
  - Use of lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples for logical modeling.

### Platforms
- **Roblox Studio**  
  - Intermediate usage: Explorer, Workspace, Properties, and hierarchy.  
  - LocalScript, Script & ModuleScript (in progress).  
  - UI systems (e.g., health bar, inventory).  
  - Event handling (`RemoteEvent`, `BindableEvent`, `Touched`, etc.).  
  - External modules: `ShapecastHitbox`.

- **Git & GitHub**  
  - Basic usage: `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`.  
  - Project organization with `README`, `.gitignore`, and `branches`.

## üéØ Future Focus

- Combat system design (PvE & PvP)  
- Game architecture (components, modularity)  
- Emergent systems and non-linear storytelling (inspired by *RimWorld* / *Dwarf Fortress*)  
- Refactoring personal engines using OOP  
- Advanced mastery of data structures and algorithms  
- Design patterns: Observer, Component, Factory, etc.  
- Creating developer tools for Roblox Studio  
- Professional collaboration on GitHub (Pull Requests, Issues, Reviews)

## üìÇ Actives Projects

- **Novel Visual Engine on Python**  
  Currently being refactored using OOP. Handles multiples scenes, dialogue, choices and smooth navigation.

- **Combat System on Roblox Studio**  
  Prototipe in progress. Includes: stamina, wheight, velocity, evasion, parry, and functional PVE logic.

### ü§ù Searching for:

- Opportunities to learn by collaborating on real proyects. 
- Technical feedback on my repositories.  
- Connections with other self-taught developers.
